# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv(unzip(activity.zip))
```

Remove the NA values
```{r}
data.noNA <- data[!is.na(data[,"steps"])]
# remove unused factors
data.noNA$date <- factor(data.noNA$date)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Sum the steps for each day, then calculate the mean and median.
```{r}
total.steps.by.day <- tapply(data.noNA$steps, data.noNA$date, sum)
mean(total.steps.by.day[!is.na(total.steps.by.day)])
#total.steps.by.day.noNA <- total.steps.by.day[!is.na(total.steps.by.day)]
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
