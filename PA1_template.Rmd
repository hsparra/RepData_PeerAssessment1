# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv(unzip(activity.zip))
```

Remove the NA values
```{r}
noNA <- data[!is.na(data[,"steps"])]
mean.steps.per.day <- tapply(noNA$steps, noNA$date, mean)
median.steps.per.day <- tapply(noNA$steps, noNA$date, median)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
